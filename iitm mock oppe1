Q--  para is a sequence of space-separated words. All words will be in lower case. There will be a single space between consecutive words. The string has no other special characters other than the space.

Write a function named exact_count that accepts the string para and a positive integer 
�
n as arguments. You have to return True if there is at least one word in para that occurs exactly 
�
n times, and False otherwise.

Ans--def exact_count(para, n):
    # Split the input string into words
    words = para.split()

    # Create a dictionary to store word occurrences
    word_counts = {}

    # Count the occurrences of each word in the input string
    for word in words:
        word_counts[word] = word_counts.get(word, 0) + 1

    # Check if there is any word that occurs exactly n times
    for count in word_counts.values():
        if count == n:
            return True

    # If no word occurs exactly n times, return False
    return False
